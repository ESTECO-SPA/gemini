# GEMINI PROJECT
This project is a collaboration between [ESTECO](https://www.esteco.com/) and [VISCANDO](https://viscando.com/) to build an infrastructure able to connect an IRL model (but also a generic one) to the [Esmini simulator](https://github.com/esmini/esmini). 

- If you need to set up your environment to run the code, please follow these instructions: [doc/environment.md](doc/environment.md)
- For the contribution of ESTECO to the project see [contribution/contribution.md](contribution/contribution.md)
