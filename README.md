# GEMINI PROJECT
This project is a collaboration between [ESTECO](https://www.esteco.com/) and [VISCANDO](https://viscando.com/) to create an infrastructure able to connect an agent guided by a custom logic to the [Esmini simulator](https://github.com/esmini/esmini). For this project we used a logic based on an Inverse Reinforcement Learning model provided by VISCANDO. The aim of the project is to identify difficulties connecting these models to the Esmini simulator (for more details see [contribution/contribution.md](contribution/contribution.md))
