## QUICK START
### Use the the encoded model
The source code of IRL architecture and IRL model developed during this project is not available on this repository.
You can download an executable which encode the original model [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F8vK_qmj0Rz_4y3kK31fwp8YRm364Ldv/view?usp=sharing) 
it has been created using pyInstaller and it is not performing properly mainly beecause the delay in reconstructing the model action. Please follow the next steps. 
- extract this zip file in the DATA_PATH folder.
- run `contribution/irl_model_encoded.py`
